# Underwater landcruiser

This is the World's first true Underwater Car

In July 2023, we drove it 7km across Darwin Harbour, 30m deep at is peak

It's call the Mudcrab - it's a fully electric, underwater-rated 1978 Toyota Landcruiser 

It was built and driven by 'ragtag team of engineers, commercial divers and revheads' according to ABC News Australia, which is about right.
